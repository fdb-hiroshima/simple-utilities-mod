- Put the downloaded Mod `.jar` into the `.minecraft/mods` folder
    - Or if you're using MultiMC, open the Minecraft instance settings you're using, and look for an option to add a Mod there

## Planned features

- Allow the User to toggle the HUD utilities, both individually and as a whole, could be done either with Hotkeys or with a Settings interface, possibly both
- Add durability colors to Armour
- Add current status effects duration to HUD
- Add Sun/Moon icons to the current game time, so it's easier to notice if it's Day or Night

## FAQ

- **Does this Mod work on versions below 1.15?**
    - No, it *might* work on 1.14 with some changes, but not anything below 1.14, since this Mod is made with Fabric, which only supports Minecraft 1.14 and above.

- **Will this Mod get me banned from *X multiplayer server*?**
    - Maybe, maybe not, the Mod is entirely Client-sided and does not require it to be installed on the Server, and mostly shows things already available to you at all times like coordinates and Cardinal directions, like an extended but simplified F3 Menu, but it has some exceptions, like very specific Game time, so some servers may not allow it, do look into the Server's rules carefully before using it, do **not** create issues here asking about that, since i won't know.

- **Will you add '*X feature not present in the [Planned Features](#planned-features) section*'**?
    - Maybe, and only if it fits with the other features of the mod, create [an issue](https://github.com/johnvictorfs/simple-utilities-mod/issues/new) about it, i only on this project on my spare time, but i'd be happy to add wanted features, although i only made this Mod for my own usage.
